Additional report:
For the supplementary report, I opted to showcase the count of appointments per country. Employing an SQL query enriched with inner joins, I efficiently amalgamated data from three tables, yielding a concise output of two columns: "Country" and "Count". The query complexity was effectively managed, simplifying the Java-side implementation. This data was seamlessly integrated into a TableView, allowing for clear and straightforward data presentation.

How to run program:
User needs a valid username and password. Then she can interact with the main screen. Then she can make appointments or interact with the customers ui or generate reports based on the buttons from the main screen after logging in.
